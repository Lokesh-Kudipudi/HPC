You have been asked to speed up core parts of three different applications. Your job is to measure performance, find bottlenecks, and suggest optimizations using timing functions and GPROF.  

Task:
You have a dataset of simulated daily temperatures for 50 years (â‰ˆ 18,250 values).
Implement two versions to sort this dataset:  Bubble Sort (for baseline) and Quicksort (efficient approach)
Measure:  Execution time for each algorithm.
GPROF report for each. 
Analyze:  
                        1. Which is faster and why?
                        2. Measure and compare the execution time of different algorithms.
                        3. Identify performance bottlenecks using GPROF.
                        4. Analyze how problem size affects performance.
